Dungeons & Dragons is a fascinating game of imagination and creativity that can be played with the barest of materials; however, that doesn't mean its not fun to have cool and interesting items play with! Here I've gathered some of my larger Dungeons & Dragons related projects that were created to improve with the playing experience.


This dice storage and rolling space, one of my first D&D specific creations, was made form an old encyclopedia and popsicle sticks. The space for the dice and rolling area was created by cutting out sections of individual pages while the wood 'planks' were stained popsicle sticks glued to a fabric backing. Altogether these elements created a surprisingly sophisticated look.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/D&D/book1.jpg" title="Fabric Backing" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/D&D/book2.jpg" title="Finished Book" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/D&D/book3.jpg" title="Top Down View" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

Similar to this 'dice book' I also created a Dice Box from a preconstructed balsa wood box, styrafaom, and felt. Using the foam to fill out an area to hold dice securely and covering it in felt I created a secure Dice Box with a lid that doubled as a rolling space. Using a wood burner I was able to transfer a design to the lid to add some more character.

   </div>

My favorite project, as well as my largest D&D related project, is my Dungeon Master Screen. The screen was created from four panels of wood secured together with hinges to give the ability to fold the screen for storage and transportation. The screen also has woodburned designes on each panel as well as a magnetic strip along the back to help hold papers and notes.

And no D&D section is complete without a couple of painted Miniatures!

During my time working at the Texas A&M University Fischer Engineering & Design Center Machine Shop (<a href='https://fedc.engr.tamu.edu/'>FEDC</a>) I commonly designed and machined many parts for the purpose of shop improvement. To create these parts I would have to evaluate the problem at hand and decide on a suitable material, design, and machining process.
Most often the items I created were copies or replacments of broken or high demand parts.

One such item is this machined peg used to hold a metal shelf on a hydrolic press.

    </div>

Another item of high demand was the saw push sticks.Pictured below you can see the original push stick (bottom) compared to my copy (top)

    </div>

One of the more precise copies I made to replace commonly broken parts was of Lathe Lever Knobs. Originally made of plastic, after only a few uses these knobs would break leaving a sharp threaded rod as the only handle to operate the lathe. To fix this I created several copies of the knobs out of aluminum to replace and improve the broken plastic ones. The replacements can be seen next to the original below.

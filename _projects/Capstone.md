As part of the senior engineering classes at Texas A&M University groups of 6 engineering students are assigned a 'project' brought to the school by an industry sponser. These sponsors are usually private companies or government organizations looking for engineering solutions to specific issues. The engineering students work with their assigned sponsor over two semesters to develop a solution that fulfills the sponsor's project requirements.

For our Engineering Capstone Project my group and I were tasked with designing and fabricating a **Pistol Recoil Simulator** that could test the durability of different pistol accessories. During this project I was the lead engineer designing and fabricating the Pistol Recoil Simulator's 'Mounting System.' If you would like to know more about the design and fabrication process of the entire mechanism my team's final engineering review can be found by hitting the *PDF* button in the top right corner of this page.

Below you can see the entire Pistol Recoil Simulator as both a CAD model and a physical mechanism post fabrication. The general idea of this design is that a rod attached to a powerful, compressed spring will release every second to strike the tip of the 'Mounting System' to simulate a gunshot. The 'Mounting System' is located on the left of the mechanism (in blue on the CAD model) and the powerful spring is housed in an aluminum cylinder on the right (in green on the CAD model). The purpose of this mounting design is to simulate the kinematics of a pistol by pivoting the accessory mounting point to immitate a person's wrist absorbing recoil.

The mounting system itself is made out of various components (labeled below) fabricated using a variety of techniques. Several components were CNC machined by the Texas A&M Machine Shop, such as the Actuating Slide, Slide Base, and Hard Stop; however, many of the components were manually manufactured.

The manually manufactured parts included the Front and Back Plates, the Interchangeable Mount, and many of the mounting holes for CNC machined components. Of these manually manufactured parts, two examples of my work can be seen below.

The first is the Front Plate meant to hold the extension springs in place. This part is made from steel sheet and cut using a horizontal bandsaw. The cut metal had the mounting holes drilled then was bent to shape.

The second is the Parallel Resting Plate meant to hold the end of the Mounting System parallel to the strong spring and striking rod. This part was machined using a manual mill to the listed specifications. The part drawings can be seen compared to the finished part below.

To support the impact of the striking rod on the mounting system my team decided to fabricate our own table. To do this some of my team and I learned to MIG weld. After completing a short welding course and creating some practice peices we welded our table. The table itself consisted of 6 vertical sections welded to 12 shorter horizontal sections resulting in 24 connecting points each needing 4 welds. After welding the base together we then welded a steel sheet on the base to act as a table top.

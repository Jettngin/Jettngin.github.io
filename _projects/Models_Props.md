Model making and prop fabrication has intrigued me ever since I was young and could understand that people actually _made_ the cool stuff I was seeing on screen. After realizing my role model Adam Savage had been a prop maker for Industrial Light & Magic on many classic films of my childhood I was hooked and started trying my hand at creating props and models.

The most recent, and most challenging, project I completed is a scale model of an <a href='https://www.hotcars.com/audi-quattro-s1-greatest-rally-car-in-history/'>Audi Quattro Rally Car</a> using a HotWheels model as its main feature. Inspired by photographs such as the one below showing the car pushing the limits of what was possible I set out to create a model that captured this energy.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/AudiQuatro3.jpg" title="Quatro Jumping" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


Starting with a square of styrafaom I roughly modeled the terrain by carving and melting the foam (always done in a well ventelated area) to create the form of a muddy, potholed road. After finishing the initial form getting an idea of the general layout I layered a mix of modge podge and acrylic paint onto the terrain to seal the foam surface.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/progress1.jpg" title="Foam Base" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/progress2.jpg" title="Terrain Mix" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

When the terrain mix was dry I painted the sections and added a fenceline made of toothpicks and twine. I also added grass to the outside sections and UV resin to the road to give the effect of standing water in the potholes and tire tracks.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/jump1.jpg" title="Model Progress" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/jump2.jpg" title="Model Progress" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Props & Models/jump3.jpg" title="Model Progress" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

After everything was in place I added some mud and water effects to the car to show off of the muddy conditions and polished up the base.

Apart from the Audi model I have also created a real life version of a _Spirited Away_  Bath Tile and a Birdhouse 'fairy garden'

I've had a love for woodworking ever since my first shop class in high school where I learned to use both hand tools and shop machinery. In this class I made everything from hand carved spoons to wood replicas of Naruto's Shuriken. Below you can see some of the pieces I made while taking this class, which was unfortunately interrupted by Covid in 2020.

Recently I have come back to woodworking during my travels of the United States as a meditative activity when camping in secluded areas. Using limited tools and naturally available wood I began reteaching myself how to whittle a spoon. After finding a suitably sized stick I used a standard 3" pocket knife to rough out the main body of the spoon before starting on carving the bowl. Since I did not have access to a gouge, the standard way to carve a bowl into a spoon, I had to use an interesting alternative method. This method involved putting a hot coal from a fire on the bowl portion of the spoon and blowing. If done correctly, the result is that the portion of the wood that needs to be removed to form the bowl of the spoon will burn away leaving only charred portions of the wood which can be scraped smooth with a stick or rock. After burning the bowl into the spoon successfully I then would start on the final shaping and eventually sanding of the spoon. Below are the three spoons I created while traveling along the east coast. The wood for each spoon was found at different campsites all across the country and created usually over the course of a couple of days. As seen here I quickly improved with practice making a near perfect spoon on my third attempt.

After finishing my second spoon I wanted to try and challenge myself (and take a break from blowing on hot coals!) and create a different utensil such as a fork or chopsticks. After breaking one fork and successfully creating another I quickly started trying my hand at sculpting using small tools meant for fingernail care to take small cuts out of soft pieces of wood before sanding the pieces down to their final shape.

My most recent woodworking project has been a wooden walking stick which I had worked on over the course of a month shaping and sanding to get to a satisfactory look and surface finish. The final result, shown below, is an extremely smooth, light, and sturdy walking stick that I plan on taking with me to my next hike.

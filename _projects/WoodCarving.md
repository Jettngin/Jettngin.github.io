I've had a love for woodworking ever since my first shop class in high school where I learned to use both hand tools and shop machinery. In this class I made everything from hand carved spoons to wood replicas of Naruto's Shuriken. Below you can see some of the pieces I made while taking this class, which was unfortunately interrupted by Covid in 2020.

Recently I have come back to woodworking during my travels of the United States as a meditative activity when camping in secluded areas. Using limited tools and naturally available wood I began reteaching myself how to whittle a spoon. After finding a suitably sized stick I used a standard 3" pocket knife to rough out the main body of the spoon before starting on carving the bowl. Since I did not have access to a gouge, the standard way to carve a bowl into a spoon, I had to use an interesting alternative method. This method involved putting a hot coal from a fire on the bowl portion of the spoon and blowing. If done correctly, the result is that the portion of the wood that needs to be removed to form the bowl will burn away leaving only charred portions of the wood which can be scraped smooth with a stick or rock. After burning the bowl into the spoon successfully I then would start on the final shaping and eventually sanding of the spoon.

Then I say something here about how I branched out to whittle forks and other utensils such as chopsticks. Maybe even throw in how I started sculpting with wood using nail tools and sandpaper.

During high school I began to learn the basics of ceramic sculpture and throwing through a formal ceramics class. While the class had various assignments students were still largely given artistic freedom for each piece they created. Some examples of these assignments can be seen below. The <a href='https://www.si.edu/spotlight/american-face-vessels'>American Face Jug</a> shown combined throwing and sculpting techniques to create a piece inspired by historical pottery of the American South. To test my throwing skills I created various types of ceramic wares such as plates, bowls, cups, and even teapots (which is pictured below). I also created many ceramic sculptures throughout the class, one of which was the 'Military Gnome' below.

I also completed a handful of other projects during this class, some of these are pictured here.

After the finishing my high school ceramics class I stayed interested in sculpting with clay. Though I did not have access to a kiln I made due with air dry clay and acrylic paints creating sculptures of whatever inspired me at the moment. One of my proudest creations was this miniature singer sewing machine I created for a friend.

Though it was just one of many sculptures I've completed over the years.
